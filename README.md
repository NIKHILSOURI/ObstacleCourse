#Obstacle Assault (UE5 C++ 3D Platformer)

A small 3D platformer built in Unreal Engine 5.4.1 as part of the Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games course.
Navigate moving/rotating platforms, avoid hazards, and reach the goal.

Highlights

UE5 C++ + Blueprints: Core gameplay in C++ with Blueprint-based iteration.

Reusable actors: Moving/rotating platform components with editable UPROPERTY fields.

C++ ↔ Blueprint: Call C++ functions from Blueprints and pass data between them.

Game rules in GameMode: Centralized win/lose logic and level flow.

Clean project layout: Starter content trimmed; gameplay code isolated under Source/ObstacleAssault.

What I Learned

Creating custom C++ classes with UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere/DefaultsOnly) for designer-friendly tuning.

Inheriting from base C++ classes and creating Blueprints for variants.

Calling C++ functions from Blueprint nodes and exchanging data safely.

Implementing a GameMode to define level rules and win conditions.
